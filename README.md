## Quantum Number Solver
Quantum number solver in Python (for my homework and my exam)

### Logic
n = the number (e.g: 3) <br> 
l = the layer (e.g: 2 | 3D) <br> 
m = the position (from -l to +l)  <br> 
    |-->( e.g: -2 = [-2 | -1 | 0 | +1 | +2] ) <br> 
    |--> Given -1: going to run all the way to -1, using S (spin) <br> 
s = spin/how to find the atom (+1/2 or -1/2 | e.g = +1/2 = 1) <br>
if m = -1 and s = +1/2: <br> 
    This is our table: <br> 
    [-2 | -1 | 0 | +1 | +2] <br> 
           ^-- is where we want to go but using the + (plus) way <br> 
           ^-- plus way is the default starting found method <br> 
    [^  | ^  |   |   |   ] <br> 
    ^-----^----- both are up arrows because we are using the + (plus) way (up arrow) <br> 
    ^-----------> now its just count how much arrows there are! <br> 
    Our Valence Layer / Valence Electron / Valence Shell is 3DÂ² <br>  <br> 
3D2 is our last layer! cool, right?!
